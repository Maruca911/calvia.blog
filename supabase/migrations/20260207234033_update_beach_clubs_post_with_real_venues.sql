  content = '<p>When the afternoon heat fades and the light turns golden, Calvia comes alive with some of Mallorca''s finest beach clubs, chiringuitos, and sunset bars. From world-famous names like Puro Beach and Nikki Beach to beloved local chiringuitos where you eat with sand between your toes, this guide covers the best spots for evening drinks and dining along Calvia''s stunning coastline.</p>

<h2>Premium Beach Clubs</h2>

<h3>Puro Beach - Illetas</h3>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> Playa de Illetas, Calvia<br />
<strong>Vibe:</strong> Luxury Balinese-inspired beach club, curated music, premium cocktails<br />
<strong>Website:</strong> <a href="https://www.purobeach.com/en/beach-club-illetas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">purobeach.com</a></p>

<p>Puro Beach Illetas is arguably the most iconic beach club on the southwest coast of Mallorca. Described as an "Oasis del Mar", it sits directly on the shore at Illetas with panoramic views across the Bay of Palma. The Balinese-inspired decor, resident DJs, and meticulously crafted cocktail menu create an experience that has earned Puro Beach a loyal international following.</p>

<p>The food programme goes well beyond typical beach club fare - expect Mediterranean plates with Asian influences, fresh seafood, and beautifully presented sharing dishes. Their Thursday sunset sessions with live acoustic music are particularly atmospheric. The wellness offering includes yoga by the sea and recovery brunches.</p>

<p><strong>Must-try:</strong> Arrive by 6pm for sunset drinks on the front terrace. Book ahead in July and August.<br />
<strong>Price range:</strong> Premium (sunbed from EUR 30-60, cocktails EUR 14-18, mains EUR 22-35)</p>

<h3>Nikki Beach - Magaluf</h3>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> Avenida Notario Alemany 1, 07181 Magaluf, Calvia<br />
<strong>Vibe:</strong> Global luxury beach club brand, poolside DJs, glamorous crowd<br />
<strong>Website:</strong> <a href="https://nikkibeach.com/mallorca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nikkibeach.com/mallorca</a></p>

<p>Nikki Beach brought its world-renowned brand of barefoot luxury to Calvia, and the <a href="/blog/santa-ponsa-vs-magaluf-comparison">Magaluf</a> location delivers on the global promise. With a beachfront pool, international DJ line-ups, champagne service, and a see-and-be-seen atmosphere, this is Calvia''s most glamorous evening destination.</p>

<p>The food is surprisingly strong for a venue known primarily for its party atmosphere. Sushi, Mediterranean seafood, and signature dishes hold their own against standalone restaurants. Weekend brunches are the signature event, combining food, drinks, and entertainment into a full afternoon experience.</p>

<p><strong>Must-try:</strong> Sunday brunch party - one of the best in Mallorca. Book well in advance.<br />
<strong>Price range:</strong> Premium (minimum spend policies may apply on weekends)</p>
