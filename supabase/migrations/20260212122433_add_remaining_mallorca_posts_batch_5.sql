  'Mallorca Car Rental: Complete Guide to Renting Cars in 2026',
  'Everything you need to know about car rental in Mallorca including companies, prices, insurance, driving tips, and how to get the best deals.',
  '<h2>Mallorca Car Rental Guide</h2>
<p>Renting a car in Mallorca unlocks the island''s full potential, providing freedom to explore hidden beaches, mountain villages, and authentic restaurants beyond tourist zones. Mallorca car rental offers excellent value and convenience, with competitive rates and numerous providers. This guide covers everything from choosing rental companies to navigating island roads.</p>

<h2>Why Rent a Car in Mallorca</h2>
<p>Public transport connects major towns but limits access to Mallorca''s best hidden spots. Car rental enables spontaneous detours, beach hopping, and exploring at your pace. Many highlights require driving—remote coves, mountain villages, and countryside wineries remain inaccessible without a vehicle. Mallorca''s compact size means nowhere sits more than 90 minutes'' drive, making car rental incredibly practical.</p>

<h2>Mallorca Car Rental Companies</h2>
<h3>International Brands</h3>
<p>Major companies like Hertz, Avis, Sixt, Europcar, and Enterprise operate across Mallorca with airport and town locations. These established brands provide reliable service, newer vehicles, and straightforward processes. Prices run higher but quality consistency and extensive networks provide peace of mind for Mallorca car rental.</p>

<h3>Local Companies</h3>
<p>Centauro, Goldcar, Record Go, and OK Rent a Car dominate local Mallorca car rental market with competitive prices. These companies often beat international brands on cost while maintaining good service. Read reviews carefully as quality varies between locations.</p>

<h3>Online Aggregators</h3>
<p>Sites like Rentalcars.com, Auto Europe, and Kayak compare multiple Mallorca car rental companies simultaneously. These platforms often secure best prices through bulk booking. Always verify final price includes all mandatory fees before booking.</p>

<h2>Mallorca Car Rental Prices</h2>
<p>Rates vary dramatically by season, car type, and booking time. Economy cars cost €15-25 daily in low season, rising to €35-60+ daily in peak summer. Weekly rentals provide better daily rates. Booking 2-3 months ahead reduces prices significantly. Automatic transmissions cost €5-15 extra daily. Larger vehicles, SUVs, and luxury cars command premium prices.</p>

<h2>Insurance for Mallorca Car Rental</h2>
<p>Understand insurance options before picking up your Mallorca rental car. Basic insurance (CDW) covers major damage but leaves significant excess. Full coverage eliminates excess but costs more. Third-party insurance providers offer cheaper alternatives to rental company policies. Credit cards sometimes include rental car insurance—verify coverage before travel. Never decline all insurance—Mediterranean driving requires protection.</p>

<h2>What You Need to Rent a Car</h2>
<p>Mallorca car rental requires valid driver''s license held at least one year. International licenses required for non-EU drivers. Credit card in driver''s name for deposit—debit cards rarely accepted. Minimum age typically 21, with young driver fees applying under 25. Additional drivers must present licenses and appear on contract. Bring booking confirmation, passport, and return flight details.</p>

<h2>Where to Rent Cars in Mallorca</h2>
<h3>Airport Rental</h3>
<p>Most visitors rent cars at Palma Airport where all major companies maintain desks. Convenient for immediate island exploration but busiest location. Allow extra time for collection during peak hours. Airport rentals include drop-off convenience when departing.</p>

<h3>City and Town Locations</h3>
<p>Rental offices in Palma, Alcudia, and major resort areas provide flexibility for those spending initial days without cars. Often quieter than airport locations with more personalized service.</p>

<h2>Fuel Policy</h2>
<p>Most Mallorca car rental operates full-to-full fuel policy—collect with full tank, return full. Verify fuel level at collection and photograph gauge. Failing to refill incurs expensive refueling charges plus service fees. Some companies offer prepaid fuel—rarely good value unless you return completely empty.</p>

<h2>Driving in Mallorca</h2>
<h3>Road Conditions</h3>
<p>Major roads in Mallorca maintain excellent condition. Mountain roads twist dramatically with steep drops and limited barriers. The Ma-10 coastal mountain route offers spectacular views but demands confident driving. Village streets run narrow, challenging for large vehicles.</p>

<h3>Traffic and Parking</h3>
<p>Palma experiences typical city traffic and limited parking. Blue zones require paid parking tickets. Resort areas get congested in peak season. Mountain villages offer free parking but tight spaces. Most hotels provide parking—verify before booking Mallorca accommodation.</p>

<h3>Speed Limits</h3>
<p>Urban areas: 50km/h; Main roads: 90-100km/h; Motorways: 120km/h. Speed cameras operate throughout Mallorca. Fines sent to rental companies who charge your card plus admin fee.</p>

<h3>Road Rules</h3>
<p>Drive on right. Roundabouts give way to left. Don''t use phone while driving. Seat belts mandatory. Drink-drive limit 0.05%—stricter than some countries. Keep rental documents and license in car always.</p>

<h2>Best Car Types for Mallorca</h2>
<p>Economy cars handle most needs economically. Small cars navigate narrow village streets easily. For mountain roads, slightly larger cars provide more comfort. Four-seat convertibles popular for sunshine driving but lack luggage space. Families need estate cars or small SUVs. Automatic transmission costs more but eases mountain driving stress.</p>

<h2>Car Rental Tips</h2>
<p>Book well ahead for peak season availability and prices. Read terms carefully regarding mileage limits, cross-border travel, and breakdown assistance. Photograph car thoroughly before leaving lot, noting every scratch and dent. Verify spare tire, jack, and warning triangle present. Keep emergency number accessible. Fill tank before returning—station near airport often busy. Return during office hours to avoid after-hours disputes. Download offline maps before traveling to remote areas.</p>

<h2>Alternatives to Car Rental</h2>
<p>Taxis suit short trips and airport transfers. Buses connect major towns but limit flexibility. Bicycles work for local exploration. Organized tours eliminate driving concerns while visiting highlights. Many visitors rent cars for 2-3 days rather than full holidays, balancing costs with flexibility.</p>',
