<h2>2. Portals Nous Beach - Most Scenic</h2>
<p>Located near the prestigious <a href="https://www.puertoportals.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Puerto Portals marina</a>, Portals Nous beach combines natural beauty with upscale amenities. The crystal-clear turquoise waters and fine white sand create a postcard-perfect setting. This beach attracts a more sophisticated crowd and offers excellent beachfront dining options.</p>

<p>The beach is relatively small (80m wide) but well-maintained, with calm waters ideal for swimming. Visit in the early morning to avoid crowds and secure the best spots near the pine trees that provide natural shade.</p>

<h2>3. Cala Fornells - Best Hidden Gem</h2>
<p>Cala Fornells is a small rocky cove that remains one of Calvia''s best-kept secrets. Unlike the larger resort beaches, this 50-meter cove offers privacy and stunning underwater visibility for snorkeling. The rock formations create natural pools perfect for exploring marine life. For more secret spots, read our guide to <a href="/blog/hidden-beaches-calvia-secret-coves-worth-discovering">hidden beaches of Calvia</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Insider Tip:</strong> Bring water shoes as the beach is pebbly. The nearby beach bar serves excellent paella with views over the bay.</p>

<h2>4. Palmanova Beach - Best All-Rounder</h2>
<p>Palmanova''s three interconnected beaches (Playa Palmanova, Playa Son Matias, and Playa Carregador) offer 900 meters of golden sand. This <a href="https://www.blueflag.global/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blue Flag beach</a> combines excellent facilities with beautiful surroundings, making it ideal for longer beach days.</p>

<p>The promenade behind the beach is lined with restaurants, shops, and cafes. Water quality is consistently excellent, and the gradual slope makes it safe for swimmers of all abilities.</p>

<h2>5. Portals Vells - Most Beautiful</h2>
<p>Many consider Portals Vells the most beautiful beach in Calvia. This collection of three small coves (Platja Gran, Platja d''en Mago, and Platja Petita) features pristine sand, pine forests, and spectacular cliff scenery. The water here is remarkably clear, perfect for snorkeling.</p>

<p><strong>Getting There:</strong> Drive to the end of the paved road and walk 10 minutes. Arrive before 11am to secure parking in summer. No facilities - bring food and water.</p>

<h2>6. Magaluf Beach - Best for Nightlife</h2>
<p>While famous for nightlife, Magaluf Beach is actually a beautiful 1km stretch of soft sand with excellent facilities. The beach offers every water sport imaginable, from jet skiing to parasailing. Despite its party reputation, the beach is well-maintained and family-friendly during daylight hours. After a beach day, explore the <a href="/blog/beach-clubs-sunset-bars-calvia-best-evening-spots">best sunset bars in Calvia</a>.</p>

<h2>7. Camp de Mar Beach - Most Tranquil</h2>
<p>Camp de Mar offers a peaceful alternative to busier Calvia beaches. This small bay features calm, clear water and a unique restaurant built on a small island connected by a wooden walkway. The beach is backed by luxury hotels and residential areas, creating a sophisticated atmosphere.</p>

<h2>8. Cala Vinyes - Best for Snorkeling</h2>
<p>Cala Vinyes is a quieter beach with excellent underwater visibility. The rocky sections on either side of the sandy beach create ideal snorkeling conditions. This residential beach attracts mainly local families and villa renters, giving it a more authentic Mallorcan feel.</p>

<p>Galatzo (1,027m) is Calvia''s highest peak and offers the most challenging hiking trail in the area. This circular route from La Reserva adventure park climbs steeply through pine forests before reaching the summit ridge with 360-degree views across western Mallorca.</p>

<p>The summit views are extraordinary - you''ll see from Palma Bay to the western tip of the island. On clear days, you can even spot Ibiza. The descent follows a different route through varied terrain including Mediterranean scrubland.</p>

<h2>3. Portals Vells Coastal Trail</h2>
<p><strong>Distance:</strong> 7km | <strong>Duration:</strong> 2 hours | <strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy</p>

<p>This easy coastal walk is perfect for families and offers spectacular sea views without demanding elevation gain. The trail starts at El Toro beach and follows the coastline to <a href="/blog/best-beaches-calvia-complete-guide">Portals Vells</a>, passing through pine forests with glimpses of turquoise coves below.</p>

<p>The trail is well-marked and shaded for most of the route. It''s walkable year-round and particularly beautiful in spring when wildflowers bloom. Finish with a swim at one of Portals Vells'' beautiful beaches.</p>

<h2>4. Puigpunyent Village Loop</h2>
<p><strong>Distance:</strong> 8km | <strong>Duration:</strong> 2.5 hours | <strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy-Moderate</p>

<p>Starting from the charming village of Puigpunyent, this loop trail showcases rural Calvia. The route passes through almond groves, olive terraces, and provides excellent views of Galatzo mountain. It''s especially beautiful in February when almond blossoms cover the valley in white.</p>

<p>The village itself is worth exploring - stop at one of the traditional cafes for ensaimada and coffee before or after your hike. For more on Calvia''s <a href="/blog/best-tapas-calvia-restaurants-2026">best food stops</a>, see our tapas guide.</p>
