  {
    question: 'Where are the best restaurants in Palma?',
    answer: `<p>Palma has a thriving restaurant scene spanning all budgets:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fine dining:</strong> DINS Santi Taura (Michelin-starred, modern Mallorcan), Adriaan (creative European), and Marc Fosh (Mediterranean with local ingredients)</li>
<li><strong>Tapas and small plates:</strong> La Rosa Vermuteria, Bar España (classic, no-frills tapas), and Vandal (creative sharing plates in Santa Catalina)</li>
<li><strong>Seafood:</strong> Ca'n Eduardo (harbour views, established since 1943), and the fish restaurants in the Portixol neighbourhood</li>
<li><strong>Casual:</strong> Mercat de l'Olivar (eat at the market stalls), El Perrito (burgers and cocktails), and La Molienda (brunch)</li>
<li><strong>International:</strong> Fera (Asian fusion), Naan (Indian), and Ombu (Argentinian steakhouse)</li>

  },
  {
    question: 'Is tap water safe in Mallorca?',
    answer: `<p>Tap water in Mallorca is technically safe to drink -- it meets EU safety standards and is regularly tested. However, many residents and visitors prefer bottled or filtered water because:</p>
<ul>
<li>The high mineral content (particularly calcium and chlorine) gives the water an unpleasant taste in many areas</li>
<li>Water quality varies across the island, with some areas having better-tasting tap water than others</li>
<li>The ageing pipe infrastructure in some older buildings may affect water quality at the point of delivery</li>
</ul>
<p>Bottled water is inexpensive (0.30-0.80 EUR for 1.5L in supermarkets). Restaurants typically serve bottled water. If you are staying in a self-catering apartment, a water filter jug is a practical and more environmentally friendly option. Tap water is perfectly fine for cooking, brushing teeth, and making coffee or tea.</p>`

  {
    question: 'What is the nightlife like in Mallorca?',
    answer: `<p>Mallorca's nightlife ranges from sophisticated cocktail bars to mega-clubs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Palma:</strong> The most diverse scene. Santa Catalina neighbourhood for trendy bars and restaurants. Paseo Maritimo waterfront for cocktail lounges. La Lonja area for atmospheric wine bars in medieval streets</li>
<li><strong>Magaluf:</strong> Mallorca's clubbing capital with BCM, Carwash, and the Punta Ballena strip. Peak season July-August. See our <a href="/blog/santa-ponsa-vs-magaluf-comparison">Magaluf overview</a></li>
<li><strong>El Arenal/Playa de Palma:</strong> The German-oriented party strip (Schinkenstrasse/Bierstrasse)</li>
<li><strong>Beach clubs:</strong> More refined evening experiences at venues like Puro Beach, Nikki Beach (Magaluf), and Calvia's <a href="/blog/beach-clubs-sunset-bars-calvia-best-evening-spots">sunset bars</a></li>
<li><strong>Resort bars:</strong> Most resort areas have bars and live music venues for a relaxed evening out</li>
</ul>
<p>Spanish dining culture means restaurants are busy until 11 PM or later, and clubs typically do not fill up until 1-2 AM.</p>`
  },
  {
    question: 'How hot is Mallorca in summer?',
    answer: `<p>Mallorca summers are reliably hot:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>June:</strong> Average highs of 28-30°C. Pleasant for sightseeing and beach days</li>
<li><strong>July:</strong> Average highs of 31-33°C. Occasional heatwaves can push temperatures above 38°C</li>
<li><strong>August:</strong> The hottest month, with average highs of 32-34°C. Heat can be intense, especially inland. Sea temperature peaks at 26°C</li>
<li><strong>September:</strong> Starts hot (28-30°C) and gradually cools. Often considered the best beach month due to warm seas and slightly fewer tourists</li>
</ul>
<p>Coastal areas benefit from sea breezes. Inland and urban areas (particularly Palma) experience higher temperatures. UV levels are very high -- factor 30-50 sunscreen is essential even on hazy days.

  {
    question: 'What vegetarian options in Mallorca?',
    answer: `<p>Vegetarian dining in Mallorca has improved significantly in recent years, though it remains a meat-loving culture. Options include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Traditional dishes:</strong> Tumbet (vegetable layered dish), pa amb oli with cheese and vegetables, escalivada (roasted vegetables), and gazpacho</li>
<li><strong>Palma restaurants:</strong> Bon Lloc (Mallorca's first vegetarian restaurant, established 1979), Ziva to Go (plant-based), and most modern restaurants now include dedicated vegetarian sections</li>
<li><strong>Market food:</strong> Fresh local produce, olives, cheeses, and dried fruits at weekly markets. See our <a href="/blog/complete-guide-calvia-weekly-markets-local-shops">markets guide</a></li>
<li><strong>Supermarkets:</strong> Mercadona, Eroski, and Lidl all stock vegetarian and vegan products</li>
<li><strong>Tapas:</strong> Many tapas are naturally vegetarian -- padron peppers, patatas bravas, manchego cheese, tortilla espanola</li>
</ul>
<p>When ordering, clarify "sin carne y sin pescado" (without meat and without fish). Some traditional dishes that appear vegetarian may use meat stock or ham.</p>`

  {
    question: 'What is the best time for beaches?',
    answer: `<p>Beach season in Mallorca runs from May to October, with each month offering a different experience:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>May:</strong> Warm enough for sunbathing (22-24°C), sea still cool at 18-19°C. Beaches quiet</li>
<li><strong>June:</strong> Excellent -- warm weather (28°C), sea warming to 22°C, moderate crowds. Lifeguards operational</li>
<li><strong>July-August:</strong> Peak season. Hot (31-34°C), warm seas (24-26°C), crowded beaches. Best to arrive early (before 10 AM) to secure a good spot</li>
<li><strong>September:</strong> Many locals consider this the best beach month. Still hot (28°C), warm seas (25°C), thinning crowds</li>
<li><strong>October:</strong> Hit or miss. Good years offer beach days at 22-24°C with a warm sea. Rain becomes more likely</li>
</ul>
<p>For the best of both worlds, visit in June or September. Explore our <a href="/blog/best-beaches-calvia-complete-guide">Calvia beach guide</a> for specific recommendations.</p>`
  },
  {
    question: 'How to avoid crowds in Mallorca?',
    answer: `<p>Strategic planning helps you enjoy Mallorca without the masses:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Timing:</strong> Visit in May, June, September, or October instead of July-August. Even within peak season, weekdays are quieter than weekends</li>
<li><strong>Early mornings:</strong> Arrive at popular beaches and attractions by 9-10 AM. Most package tourists arrive later</li>
<li><strong>Alternative locations:</strong> Skip the most famous beaches for equally beautiful but less-known coves. Our <a href="/blog/hidden-beaches-calvia-secret-coves-worth-discovering">hidden beaches guide</a> reveals quieter options</li>
<li><strong>Explore the interior:</strong> Most tourists stick to the coast. Inland towns like Sineu, Arta, and Petra are largely uncrowded year-round</li>
<li><strong>Winter visits:</strong> A completely different, peaceful Mallorca. See our <a href="/blog/things-to-do-calvia-winter-guide">winter guide</a></li>
<li><strong>Accommodation choice:</strong> Stay in smaller towns rather than big resort areas</li>
</ul>
<p>The Serra de Tramuntana mountains, east coast, and southern interior all offer quieter experiences than the western resort strip.</p>`
  },
  {
    question: 'What local drinks to try?',
    answer: `<p>Mallorca has several distinctive local beverages worth seeking out:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hierbas:</strong> A traditional herbal liqueur made from anise, rosemary, marjoram, and other Mediterranean herbs. Served as a digestif after meals. Ranges from sweet (<em>dulces</em>) to dry (<em>secas</em>)</li>
<li><strong>Palo:</strong> A dark, bittersweet liqueur made from quinine bark and gentian root. Often mixed with soda or gin. Unique to Mallorca</li>
<li><strong>Mallorcan wine:</strong> The Binissalem DO (Denomination of Origin) region produces quality reds and whites, mainly from indigenous Manto Negro and Prensal Blanc grapes. Vi de la Terra (country wine) is also good</li>
<li><strong>Fresh orange juice:</strong> Especially in the Soller valley, made from locally grown oranges</li>
<li><strong>Gin:</strong> Mallorca has a gin-making tradition dating back to the British presence in the 18th century. Gin amb llimonada (gin with cloudy lemonade) is a popular summer drink</li>
<li><strong>Almendra (almond milk):</strong> Refreshing cold drink made from local almonds</li>
</ul>`
  },
  {
    question: 'Is Mallorca rainy in winter?',
    answer: `<p>Winter is Mallorca's wettest season, but "rainy" needs context. November to February sees the most rainfall, with an average of 6-8 rainy days per month. However:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rain often falls in short, intense bursts rather than continuous drizzle</li>
<li>Many winter days are bright and sunny between showers</li>
<li>Palma averages approximately 5-6 hours of sunshine per day even in December and January</li>
<li>The Tramuntana mountains receive significantly more rain than the south and east coast</li>
<li>Temperatures rarely drop below 5°C at sea level, though mountain areas can see snow</li>
</ul>
<p>A winter trip to Mallorca is far from a washout. Pack a waterproof jacket and embrace the quieter, greener side of the island. Our <a href="/blog/calvia-winter-off-season-best-time-visit">winter visit guide</a> covers activities and advantages of the off-season.</p>`
  },
  {
    question: 'What markets to visit in Mallorca?',

<li><strong>Inca (Thursday):</strong> Famous for leather goods (Inca is Mallorca's leather-making centre) plus a large general market</li>

  {
    question: 'How to eat gluten-free in Mallorca?',
    answer: `<p>Eating gluten-free in Mallorca is manageable with some preparation:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Awareness:</strong> Spain has one of the highest rates of coeliac disease in Europe, so there is relatively good awareness. Many restaurants understand "sin gluten" (gluten-free)</li>
<li><strong>Labelling:</strong> Supermarkets (Mercadona, Eroski, Lidl) carry dedicated gluten-free sections with bread, pasta, and biscuits. Products carry the "sin gluten" label</li>
<li><strong>Naturally GF dishes:</strong> Tumbet, grilled fish and meats, salads, rice dishes, and many tapas (patatas bravas, grilled vegetables, jamon) are naturally gluten-free</li>
<li><strong>Caution:</strong> Be careful with traditional dishes that may use flour -- croquetas, breaded fish, and some sauces. Always ask about ingredients</li>
<li><strong>Dedicated restaurants:</strong> Palma has several restaurants with extensive GF menus. Apps like "Find Me Gluten Free" can help locate options</li>
<li><strong>Useful phrase:</strong> "Soy celiaco/celiaca, no puedo comer gluten" (I have coeliac disease, I cannot eat gluten)</li>
</ul>
<p>Contact your accommodation in advance -- many hotels and rental properties can accommodate dietary requirements with notice.</p>`
  },
  {
    question: 'What is paella like in Mallorca?',
    answer: `<p>Paella is available throughout Mallorca, though it is originally a Valencian dish rather than a Mallorcan one. Here is what to expect:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Types available:</strong> Seafood paella (the most common for tourists), mixed paella (seafood and meat), and occasionally vegetable paella</li>
<li><strong>Quality varies:</strong> Beachfront tourist restaurants often serve mediocre, mass-produced paella. For the best quality, choose restaurants where paella is a speciality, not an afterthought</li>
<li><strong>Mallorcan rice dishes:</strong> The local equivalent is <strong>arros brut</strong> ("dirty rice"), a hearty soupy rice with pork, rabbit, mushrooms, and saffron. This is more authentically Mallorcan and often better than tourist paella</li>
<li><strong>Portion size:</strong> Paella is traditionally a shared dish. Most restaurants require a minimum of two portions</li>
<li><strong>Timing:</strong> Paella is a lunch dish in Spain, not a dinner dish. Restaurants that serve it at lunch generally prepare it fresh, while evening paella may be reheated</li>
</ul>
<p>For authentic local cuisine, try arros brut or fideuà (paella made with noodles instead of rice) at the restaurants in our <a href="/blog/mallorca-restaurants-dining-guide">dining guide</a>.</p>`

  {
    question: 'When does it get cold in Mallorca?',
    answer: `<p>Mallorca's definition of "cold" is mild by Northern European or North American standards:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>November:</strong> Temperatures begin to drop noticeably, averaging 14-18°C during the day. Evenings cool to 8-12°C. First significant rainfall</li>
<li><strong>December-January:</strong> The coldest months. Daytime highs of 13-15°C, nighttime lows of 4-8°C. Occasional frost inland. Serra de Tramuntana peaks may see snow</li>
<li><strong>February:</strong> Still cool (14-16°C) but almond blossom signals spring's approach</li>
<li><strong>March:</strong> Warming up to 16-18°C. Some days feel spring-like, others can be windy and wet</li>
</ul>
<p>Heating is standard in hotels and most rental accommodation from November to March. If you are accustomed to Mediterranean or tropical climates, December to February will feel cold. For Northern Europeans, Mallorca's winter feels like a mild autumn.

  {
    question: 'What seafood is famous in Mallorca?',
    answer: `<p>Mallorca's coastal location means excellent fresh seafood is widely available:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Hydration:</strong> Drink at least 2-3 litres of water daily. Carry a water bottle at all times</li>
