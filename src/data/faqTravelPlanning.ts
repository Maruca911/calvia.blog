    question: 'Is Mallorca worth visiting?',
    answer: `<p>Mallorca is one of the most rewarding destinations in the Mediterranean. The island offers a remarkable diversity of experiences: from the dramatic limestone cliffs of the <a href="/blog/calvia-hiking-trails-serra-tramuntana">Serra de Tramuntana</a> (a UNESCO World Heritage Site) to over 200 beaches ranging from long sandy stretches to secluded rocky coves. Palma de Mallorca, the capital, features a stunning Gothic cathedral, a vibrant culinary scene, and excellent shopping.</p>
<p>Beyond the beaches, visitors discover charming mountain villages like Valldemossa and Deia, world-class cycling routes, ancient Roman and Moorish ruins, and a food culture that blends traditional Mallorcan cuisine with modern Mediterranean innovation. The island receives over 12 million visitors annually for good reason. For a comprehensive overview, see our <a href="/blog/mallorca-attractions-complete-guide">complete attractions guide</a>.</p>`

  {
    question: 'When is the best time to visit Mallorca?',
    answer: `<p>The best time depends on your priorities. For beach holidays, June to September offers warm seas (22-26°C) and reliable sunshine, though July and August are the busiest months. May and October are ideal for those wanting warm weather (20-25°C) with fewer crowds and lower prices.</p>
<p>For hiking, cycling, and cultural exploration, April to May and September to November provide comfortable temperatures without the summer heat. Winter (December to February) is mild by European standards (10-15°C) and perfect for a quiet retreat -- see our guide on <a href="/blog/calvia-winter-off-season-best-time-visit">why the off-season is the best time to visit</a>.

  {
    question: 'How long should I spend in Mallorca?',
    answer: `<p>A minimum of 5-7 days allows you to explore Palma, visit several beaches, and take a day trip to the mountains or a coastal village. For a thorough experience covering multiple regions, hiking, and cultural sites, 10-14 days is recommended.</p>
<p>If you are focusing on a specific area like Calvia, 4-5 days gives you time to enjoy the <a href="/blog/best-beaches-calvia-complete-guide">local beaches</a>, <a href="/blog/best-restaurants-calvia-2026-food-guide">restaurants</a>, and nearby attractions. Weekend breaks of 3-4 days work well if you stay in Palma and limit excursions.

  {
    question: 'What is the best way to get to Mallorca?',

    question: 'Do I need a visa to visit Mallorca?',
    answer: `<p>Mallorca is part of Spain and the European Union, so entry requirements follow EU and Schengen Area rules. Citizens of EU/EEA countries need only a valid passport or national ID card. No visa is required.</p>
<p>Citizens of the United States, Canada, Australia, the UK, Japan, and many other countries can visit visa-free for up to 90 days within any 180-day period under the Schengen agreement. From 2025, non-EU visitors from visa-exempt countries are expected to need <a href="https://travel-europe.europa.eu/etias_en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ETIAS authorisation</a> (European Travel Information and Authorisation System), a simple online process costing approximately 7 EUR. Always check the latest requirements with your country's foreign affairs ministry before travel.</p>`
  },
  {
    question: 'How much does a trip to Mallorca cost?',
    answer: `<p>Costs vary significantly depending on your travel style. As a rough guide for 2026:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Budget traveller:</strong> 60-90 EUR per day (hostel or budget hotel, local restaurants, public transport)</li>
<li><strong>Mid-range:</strong> 120-200 EUR per day (3-4 star hotel, mix of dining out, rental car)</li>

  {
    question: 'What are the entry requirements for Mallorca in 2026?',
    answer: `<p>As of 2026, Mallorca follows standard Spanish and EU entry requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>EU/EEA citizens:</strong> Valid passport or national ID card</li>
<li><strong>UK citizens:</strong> Valid passport (must have at least 3 months validity beyond your planned departure date from the Schengen area)</li>
<li><strong>US/Canadian/Australian citizens:</strong> Valid passport, no visa needed for stays up to 90 days. ETIAS authorisation may be required -- check <a href="https://travel-europe.europa.eu/etias_en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the official ETIAS website</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There are no specific vaccination requirements for entry. Travel insurance is strongly recommended but not mandatory. Always verify current requirements through the <a href="https://www.exteriores.gob.es/en/Paginas/index.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a> or your country's travel advisory service before departing.</p>`

  {
    question: 'Is Mallorca safe for tourists?',
    answer: `<p>Mallorca is generally very safe for tourists. Spain consistently ranks as one of the safer countries in Europe for visitors. Violent crime against tourists is rare. The main concerns are petty crimes common to all popular tourist destinations: pickpocketing in crowded areas (particularly around Palma Cathedral, markets, and busy beaches) and occasional theft from rental cars.</p>
<p>Common-sense precautions apply: keep valuables secure, do not leave bags unattended on the beach, use hotel safes, and be aware of your surroundings in busy nightlife areas like Magaluf. Emergency services are responsive, and hospitals meet high European standards. The emergency number across Spain is 112. For more details, consult the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/spain" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UK Foreign Office travel advice for Spain</a>.</p>`
  },
  {
    question: 'What currency is used in Mallorca?',
    answer: `<p>Mallorca uses the Euro (EUR), as it is part of Spain and the Eurozone. Credit and debit cards (Visa, Mastercard) are widely accepted in hotels, restaurants, shops, and supermarkets. Contactless payment is standard at most businesses.</p>
<p>ATMs are plentiful in towns and tourist areas. It is advisable to carry some cash for small purchases, market stalls, rural cafes, and beach vendors. Be cautious of ATMs that offer "dynamic currency conversion" (charging in your home currency instead of euros) as this typically results in a poor exchange rate. Currency exchange offices are available at the airport and in Palma, though your bank card usually offers better rates.</p>`
  },
  {
    question: 'What languages are spoken in Mallorca?',
    answer: `<p>Mallorca has two official languages: <strong>Catalan</strong> (specifically the Mallorcan dialect, called <em>Mallorqui</em>) and <strong>Castilian Spanish</strong>. Official signage, government documents, and education use both languages. Most locals are fully bilingual.</p>
<p>In tourist areas, English is widely spoken, particularly in hotels, restaurants, and shops. German is also very commonly understood, especially in areas popular with German tourists such as the Calvia municipality, Alcudia, and the east coast. Mallorca has a large German expatriate community, which is why the island is sometimes called "the 17th German state." Basic Spanish phrases are always appreciated by locals.</p>`
  },
  {
    question: 'How to plan a budget trip to Mallorca?',
    answer: `<p>Several strategies help keep costs down:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Travel off-season:</strong> April-May and October offer great weather at 30-50% lower prices than July-August. See our <a href="/blog/calvia-winter-off-season-best-time-visit">off-season guide</a></li>
<li><strong>Book flights early:</strong> Budget airlines offer the best fares 2-3 months ahead. Use our <a href="/blog/flights-to-mallorca-booking-guide">flights guide</a> for tips</li>
<li><strong>Stay in apartments:</strong> Self-catering accommodation cuts food costs significantly</li>
<li><strong>Use public transport:</strong> The TIB bus network covers most of the island affordably</li>
<li><strong>Eat like a local:</strong> Opt for "menu del dia" (set lunch menu) at local restaurants for 10-15 EUR including a drink</li>
<li><strong>Free attractions:</strong> Many beaches, hiking trails, and villages cost nothing to enjoy</li>
<li><strong>Shop at markets:</strong> Visit <a href="/blog/complete-guide-calvia-weekly-markets-local-shops">local markets</a> for fresh, affordable produce</li>
</ul>`

    question: 'What are the main airports in Mallorca?',
    answer: `<p>Mallorca has one commercial airport: <strong>Palma de Mallorca Airport (PMI)</strong>, officially named Son Sant Joan Airport. It is located 8 km east of Palma city centre and is the third-busiest airport in Spain, handling over 30 million passengers annually.</p>
<p>The airport has four terminals, with Terminal A handling most international flights. Facilities include car rental desks, tourist information, currency exchange, restaurants, and shops. Transport connections from the airport include public buses (line A1 to Palma centre, line A32 to resort areas), taxis, and private transfers.

  {
    question: 'Is Mallorca family-friendly?',
    answer: `<p>Mallorca is exceptionally family-friendly and one of the top family holiday destinations in Europe. Many beaches have shallow, calm waters ideal for young children, particularly on the east coast (Cala Millor, Alcudia Bay) and in the Calvia area (<a href="/blog/best-beaches-calvia-complete-guide">see our beach guide</a>).</p>
<p>Family-oriented activities include water parks (Western Water Park, Aqualand), the Palma Aquarium, caves (Cuevas del Drach), boat trips, and the vintage Soller train. Most restaurants welcome children and many offer kids' menus. Hotels frequently provide family rooms, kids' clubs, and pools. The Alcudia and Port de Pollenca areas are particularly popular with families due to their long, safe beaches and pedestrian-friendly waterfronts.</p>`

  {
    question: 'What are the COVID-19 rules for Mallorca?',
    answer: `<p>As of 2026, Spain has lifted all COVID-19 entry restrictions. There are no vaccination, testing, or quarantine requirements for entering Mallorca. Health declaration forms are no longer required.</p>
<p>Face masks are only mandatory in healthcare settings such as hospitals and pharmacies. It is sensible to carry a mask for these situations. Public health infrastructure remains strong should circumstances change. For the most current information, check the <a href="https://www.sanidad.gob.es/en/home.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spanish Ministry of Health website</a> or the <a href="https://reopen.europa.eu/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Re-open EU portal</a>.</p>`
  },
  {
    question: 'How to get from Palma Airport to my hotel?',
    answer: `<p>Several options connect Palma Airport to hotels across the island:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Public bus:</strong> Line A1 runs to Palma city centre every 12-15 minutes (approximately 5 EUR, 20-30 minutes). Line A32 serves Arenal. The <a href="https://www.tib.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TIB bus network</a> connects to other towns</li>
<li><strong>Taxi:</strong> Available outside arrivals. Palma centre costs approximately 20-30 EUR. Metered fares, official tariffs displayed at the taxi rank</li>
<li><strong>Private transfer:</strong> Pre-bookable shuttle services run to all resort areas. Convenient for families with luggage</li>
<li><strong>Rental car:</strong> Multiple agencies at the airport. See our <a href="/blog/mallorca-car-rental-complete-guide">car rental guide</a></li>

  {
    question: 'What is the time zone in Mallorca?',
    answer: `<p>Mallorca follows Central European Time (CET), which is UTC+1 in winter and UTC+2 during summer (Central European Summer Time, CEST). Daylight saving time runs from the last Sunday in March to the last Sunday in October.</p>
<p>This means Mallorca is 1 hour ahead of the UK and Ireland, the same as most of mainland Europe (Germany, France, Italy), and 6 hours ahead of US Eastern Time (7 hours during US daylight saving). Adjust your plans accordingly when booking flights or arranging transfers.</p>`
  },
  {
    question: 'Is Mallorca expensive compared to other Spanish islands?',
    answer: `<p>Mallorca sits in the mid-to-upper range compared to other Spanish islands. It is generally more expensive than the Canary Islands (Tenerife, Gran Canaria) but comparable to Ibiza for mid-range options. Ibiza's top-end nightlife and luxury scene pushes its peak prices higher than Mallorca's.</p>
<p>Menorca is similar in price to Mallorca but with fewer budget options. Within Mallorca, costs vary significantly by area: Palma, Deia, and Port d'Andratx are notably more expensive than inland towns or the east coast. Shopping at local markets, eating at neighbourhood restaurants, and staying in apartments can make Mallorca very affordable even in summer.</p>`
  },
  {
    question: 'What packing tips for Mallorca?',
    answer: `<p>Essentials depend on the season:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Summer (June-September):</strong> Lightweight clothing, swimwear, high-SPF sunscreen, sunglasses, a hat, comfortable sandals, and a light layer for air-conditioned restaurants. Temperatures regularly reach 30-35°C</li>
<li><strong>Spring/Autumn:</strong> Layered clothing, a light jacket or cardigan for evenings, comfortable walking shoes for exploring, and a small umbrella</li>
<li><strong>Winter:</strong> Warmer layers, a waterproof jacket, and closed shoes. Temperatures are mild (10-15°C) but evenings can be cool</li>
</ul>
<p>Year-round essentials: comfortable walking shoes (cobblestone streets in old towns), a reusable water bottle, a power adapter (Type C/F European plug), and a daypack for excursions. If you plan to hike in the <a href="/blog/calvia-hiking-trails-serra-tramuntana">Serra de Tramuntana</a>, bring proper hiking boots.</p>`
  },
  {
    question: 'Can Americans visit Mallorca easily?',
    answer: `<p>Yes. US citizens can visit Mallorca without a visa for up to 90 days within any 180-day period. You need a valid US passport with at least 3 months of validity beyond your planned departure date from the Schengen area.</p>
<p>Direct flights from the US to Palma are limited, but excellent connections are available through Madrid, Barcelona, London, Frankfurt, and other European hubs. Flight time from the US East Coast to Palma (with one connection) is typically 10-14 hours total. The ETIAS travel authorisation system may be required for US visitors from 2025 onwards -- check <a href="https://travel-europe.europa.eu/etias_en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the official ETIAS portal</a> for updates. US health insurance typically does not cover Europe, so travel insurance is strongly recommended.</p>`
